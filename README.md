# hello-world

Hello there!

I'm Guilherme, a computer engineer with experience in industrial maintenance and automation (mostly with Allen Bradley products). Got experience also with SAP system, PM module.

With the outcoming of industry 4.0, got alot of time spent to study this area, starting at business intelligence to data science field (this one I'm starting, I can be tagged as a noob).
Enthusiastic with all kind of data analysis, from descriptive to predictive, got as a hobby to find a subject to create ETL routines and then make reports with the best insights that I can think of (ETL routines using Python/R and reports with Microsoft Power BI).

Get in here to share some projects and to learn new skills that I can use to get better results at my projects.
